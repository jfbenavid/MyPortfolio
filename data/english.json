    "name": "Fabian Benavides",
    "description": "I am a Systems Engineer with eight years of experience as a software developer, who has worked on multiple software development projects for different clients. I started working with Visual Basic.NET and then evolved into C# in the backend while I worked with ASP.NET/Core, Entity Framework, and Windows Services, and I also have been working with Javascript, React.js, and Angular in the frontend. I am also willing to learn new technologies and stacks. For the last years, Agile practices like SCRUM and Kanban have been part of my working days, and I also have been working as a full-stack developer leading different teams as a technical leader."
